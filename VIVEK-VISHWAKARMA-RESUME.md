#### Project: 01 | Stripe Payment Integration
**GitHub:** [https://github.com/VivekGits7/Stripe-Payment-Integration](https://github.com/VivekGits7/Stripe-Payment-Integration)

Contributed to building a secure and scalable Stripe Payment Integration System using Java Spring Boot in a microservices architecture on AWS. Participated in implementing payment processing, payment status management, Stripe PSP REST API integration, notification handling, security enhancements, and error management. Explored Spring AI with OpenAI LLM and integrated ActiveMQ for asynchronous messaging. Followed RESTful standards, applied design patterns, and strengthened debugging and problem-solving skills.

**Responsibilities:**
- Implemented Stripe integration using Java Spring Boot & Microservices, building modular payment-processing and Stripe-provider services.
- Analysed Stripe integration documentation and collaborated with the team to finalise the end-to-end integration approach.
- Developed the stripe-provider service, integrating with Rest APIs (Create, Retrieve, Expire Session).
- Implemented security mechanisms using Stripe Basic Auth for APIs and HmacSHA256 for notification processing.
- Implemented payment status tracking to ensure 100% reliability of payments.
- Developed custom error codes and applied Spring exception handling for robust error management.
- Processed incoming Stripe notification events and performed unit testing.
- Worked with MySQL (Spring JDBC) and gained hands-on experience with AWS services (EC2, RDS, Secrets Manager).
- Explored Spring AI with OpenAI LLM for dynamic Stripe error response handling and integrated ActiveMQ for asynchronous communication
- Applied design patterns (Factory, Builder) and OOP principles to build modular, maintainable services.

#### Project: 02 | Property Finder Chat AI
**GitHub:** [https://github.com/VivekGits7/Property-Search-Chat-AI](https://github.com/VivekGits7/Property-Search-Chat-AI)

Developed an intelligent Property Finder Chat AI that enables users to search real estate projects through natural language queries. Built a React + Tailwind CSS front-end integrated with a Spring Boot backend for real-time property recommendations. Designed RESTful APIs to extract filters like BHK type, budget, city, and locality from user queries and fetch matching listing properties from CSV datasets. Delivered an interactive chat-based interface that enhances property discovery with AI-driven filtering and summarisation.

**Responsibilities:**
- Designed and implemented the backend using Java Spring Boot (Microservices architecture) and developed a responsive frontend UI with React.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion for an interactive chat experience.
- Built and integrated RESTful APIs to extract key filters from user queries and fetch matching results from CSV-based property datasets.
- Developed robust data parsing and validation logic in Java to accurately interpret complex natural language inputs.
- Performed comprehensive testing and debugging using Postman and IntelliJ IDEA, ensuring seamless frontendbackend integration through environment variables and precise API endpoint mapping.
- Utilised Git and GitHub for version control, documentation, and collaborative project development and presentation.
